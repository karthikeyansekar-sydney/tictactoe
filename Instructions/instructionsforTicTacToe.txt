You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game right? That's What most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it,
you will discoed that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!

RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE:

1.The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

2.You are 'I' and your friend is 'U'. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

3.The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (Up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

4. When all 9 Squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

HOW CAN I WIN AT TIC-TAC-TOE?

To beat your friend (or at least tie), you need to make use of little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out What you need to do to win.

Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three 'I' in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three 'U's in a row.

After you put on I in a square, you start looking ahead. Whereas the best place for your next move You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choices ,
 Which ones might let you make three 'I's in a row.

You also have to watch where the other person puts his 'U's. That could change what you undo next. If the other player gets two Us in a row, you have to put next I in the last empty box in that row,
 or the other player will win. You are forced to play in a particular box or lose the game.

If you always pay attention and look ahead, you will never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you will tie.
